This is the mobile device interface. Three buttons to control the interface on the main screen: Home, Search, , and a 
Get button. Home is rather obvious, as it will bring the user back to the point prior to initial interaction. The Search
button will bring the user to the filter/graph interface minus the title and random images. This will probably be split
into two pages, or may just go with scrolling on the mobile device. The Get button will be for the final stage. If a 
user likes the recipe that they are viewing, the get button will email the recipe to the user.
