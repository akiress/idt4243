Using one of the RFID tagged index cards, the user swipes the card on the RFID reader at the bottom right of the 
display. This causes the UI to trigger the menu categories, causing that specific category to light up on the diplay.
The LED corresponding to that category will also light up, using the same color as in the display highlighted category.
The user can now either use a mobile device as before, or move towards the 3 button capacitive touch sensor box.
