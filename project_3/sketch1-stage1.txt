Initial stage of the interface. The user will walk up to the interface seeing a 6 (2x3) tiled display. On the side of
the display will be a vertical row of 8 LED's with category names. The user has two options. The user can continue 
using the UI with the mobile device as in project 2, or now can pull an RFID tagged index card from the hook above the 
LEDs. There will be 8 cards, each with a category on them. No LEDs are lit at the moment.
