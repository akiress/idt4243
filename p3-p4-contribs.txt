I worked on the LEDMenu to work as state control for LEDs. I also worked with NodeJs to devise way in which could send 
signals to LEDs via phone which we ended up not using due to install problems with nodeJs (mainly compilation errors on
the machines in Frey) and final issues with the internet connectivity on said machines.

I designed the History, Recipe, and Nutrition User Controls. I assisted with implementation of byte tags and 
visualizers, which we ended up losing in a data overwrite Tuesday morning. I verbally assisted with idea and design of 
cartouche a couple of evenings in Frey as we were trying to hammer out the design.
